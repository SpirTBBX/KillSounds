# NOTE
This plugin is no longer maintained. I'm focused on CS2 and I'm not actively developing on this, since CS2 doesn't have SourceMod support. If need help or want some modifications done to this plugin, contact me on discord @spirtdev or through steam: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198799136845 

# KillSounds
A plugin for CS:GO that plays custom kill sounds to the attacker.

# Info
For more info or sound packs, please visit the alliedmodders post -> https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2757283#post2757283

# Configure
Just set your playable files in 'cfg/SpirT/kill.sounds.cfg' and do NOT place sound/ in the file path.

# Additional Features
The plugin already precaches and adds the files to the downloads table, therefore you don't need to add them to a third party plugin. Have fun!
