# KillSounds
A plugin for CS:GO that plays custom kill sounds to the attacker.

# Info
For more info or sound packs, please visit the alliedmodders post -> https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2757283#post2757283

# Configure
Just set your playable files in 'cfg/SpirT/kill.sounds.cfg' and do NOT place sound/ in the file path.

# Additional Features
The plugin already precaches and adds the files to the downloads table, therefore you don't need to add them to a third party plugin. Have fun!
